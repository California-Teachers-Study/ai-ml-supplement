# ai-ml-supplement

In response to a Notice of Special Interest from the NIH OD that was aligned with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science, a collaborative team of City of Hope investigators from Applied AI & Data Science and Computational and Quantitative Medicine applied for and received a one-year Administrative Supplement to improve the readiness of CTS data for AI/ML applications. 

The 4 tutorial notebooks in this repository document the work and results of this Administrative Supplement, funded by NIH Grant 3U01-CA199277-08S2.

These notebooks have had person-level information redacted. The code and data for this project are available to researchers with an approved CTS project that would make use of this work. Researchers can learn more about the CTS, sign up for an account, and propose a project on the [CTS Researcher Platform](www.calteachersstudy.org).
